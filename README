===Jump

A bash script to move to bookmarked locations in your Filesystem.

==INSTALLATION

1) Get the code
mkdir ~/.jump
cd ~/.jump
git clone // or wget the code

2) Add the executables to your system PATH. This is my PATH in ~./bash_profile 
export PATH=~/.gem/ruby/1.8/bin/:/opt/local/bin:/opt/local/sbin:~/.jump/bin:$PATH

3) You have to make sure to add the following alias to your bash profile:
alias j=". j"
Beware without it the final "cd" will not work!
